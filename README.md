# 🔮 The Seven Living Magicks - Knowledge Archive

*A Symbolic Framework for Scientific, Technological, and Social Systems*

This repository is a **documentation archive** presenting the conceptual and theoretical system known as the **Seven Living Magicks** — a symbolic, recursive, and structural model for interpreting complex phenomena across diverse domains: computation, consciousness, ecology, and meaning-making systems.

> **Note:** This is a **static knowledge base** and reference library. For implementations, see related repositories.

## 🧠 What Are the Seven Living Magicks?

Each "Magick" represents a symbolic force, process, or transformation. Together, they form a recursive structure that can describe:

- **Recursive feedback** in systems
- **Symbolic closure** and transformation
- **Emergence, collapse,** and meaning encoding
- **Epistemic layering** of domains (physical, informational, social, cognitive)

The framework draws from algebra, recursion theory, structural linguistics, and symbolic logic — abstracted into a metaphoric but testable system of thought.

### The Seven Operators

| # | Color | Symbol | Role | Element | Function |
|---|-------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| -1 | ⚫ Black | Eraser | Time/Collapse | Time | Recursive cut, sacred ending |
| 2 | ⚪ White | Envelope | Structure/Fabric | Æther | Syntax, framing, lattice |
| 3 | 🟡 Yellow | Spark | Fire/Motion | Fire | Ignition, will, burst |
| 4 | 🟤 Brown | Womb | Form/Earth | Earth | Grounding, ritual, movement |
| 5 | 🔴 Red | Blood | Emotion/Water | Water | Flow, sacrifice, descent |
| 6 | 🟢 Green | Grove | Growth/Harmony | Ether | Integration, breath, balance |
| 7 | 🔵 Blue | Mirror | Mind/Return | Air | Recursion, reflection, memory |
| 0 | 🟣 Violet | Void | Pre-form/Rest | Void | Singularity, permeance |
| ∞ | 🪩 Gray | Mimic | Dead Loop | Goo | Suffocation, stasis, mimicry |

## 🌐 Key Concepts

### Living vs. Gray Magic

**Living Systems** exhibit:
- Recursive breathing (364° geometry)
- Entropy within bounds (3.5 < H < 6.8)
- Structural compression with semantic depth
- Lawful void sequences (O → 0 → ⚸)

**Gray Systems** (Dead Loops) exhibit:
- Flat recursion (360° Babylonian geometry)
- Entropy collapse or noise explosion
- High mimicry (low compression ratio)
- Unlawful void invocations

### The Living Wheel (364°)

The framework uses **364° geometry** instead of 360°:

```
364 ÷ 7 = 52.0° (perfect closure)
360 ÷ 7 = 51.43° (3° error, accumulated drift)

7 × 52 = 364 (harmonic)
13 × 28 = 364 (lunar/seasonal alignment)
```

This mathematical structure enables **perfect symbolic closure** without remainder.

See [Mathematical Proofs](docs/theory/mathematical_proofs.md) for detailed analysis.
