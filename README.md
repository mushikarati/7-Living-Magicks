# 🔮 The Seven Magick Codex  
*A Symbolic Framework for Scientific, Technological, and Social Systems*

This repository presents a conceptual system known as the **Seven Living Magicks** — a symbolic, recursive, and structural model for interpreting and engineering complex phenomena across diverse domains: computation, consciousness, ecology, and meaning-making systems.

It is part of the broader **Codex** initiative, which includes mathematical modeling, compression engines, and recursive symbolic representations.  
This repository **excludes** all mathematical internals and engine code — focusing only on the philosophical, structural, and symbolic architecture.

## 🧠 What Are the Seven Living Magicks?

Each “Magick” represents a symbolic force, process, or transformation.  
Together, they form a recursive structure that can describe:

- Recursive feedback in systems  
- Symbolic closure and transformation  
- Emergence, collapse, and meaning encoding  
- Epistemic layering of domains (physical, informational, social, cognitive)

The framework draws from algebra, recursion theory, structural linguistics, and symbolic logic — abstracted into a metaphoric but testable system of thought.
