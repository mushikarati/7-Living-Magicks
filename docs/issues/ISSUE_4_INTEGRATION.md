## Next Steps for Issue #4

**Option 1: Close the issue**
- Content has been fully integrated into repository
- Reference files are properly documented
- Tests validate the mathematical claims

**Option 2: Keep open for discussion**
- Use as reference point for architectural discussions
- Link to documentation files
- Update with references to integrated content

**Recommendation:** Update issue description with links to new files, then close as complete.
