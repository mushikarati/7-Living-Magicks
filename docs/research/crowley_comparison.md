## Potential Correspondences

### 7 Classical Planets

Crowley's system builds on classical planetary correspondences:

| Codex Color | Index | Planet | Symbolic Themes |
|-------------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| ⚫ Black    | 0     | Saturn | Endings, boundaries, structure, time |
| ⚪ White    | 1     | Moon   | Reflection, cycles, mystery |
| 🟡 Yellow   | 2     | Mercury| Communication, will, intellect |
| 🟤 Brown    | 3     | Venus  | Earth, vessel, love, creation |
| 🔴 Red      | 4     | Mars   | Force, sacrifice, blood, war |
| 🟢 Green    | 5     | Jupiter| Expansion, breath, abundance |
| 🔵 Blue     | 6     | Sol (Sun) | Reflection, unity, return |

**Note:** This mapping is **one interpretation** and not definitive.

## Thelemic Concepts

### Will (Thelema)

**Crowley:** "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law"

**Codex parallel:** 🟡 Yellow (The Spark) - ignition and will

**Similarity:** Both emphasize will as a creative force.

**Difference:** Yellow is one step in a 7-fold cycle, not a singular principle.

---

### The Abyss

**Crowley:** The void between mundane and divine consciousness

**Codex parallel:** ⚫ Black (The Eraser) or ⚿ Violet (Meta/Void)

**Similarity:** Both deal with dissolution and void states.

**Difference:** Black is part of the cycle; Violet is outside it. The Abyss is a crossing point, not a cyclic operator.

---

### True Will vs. Mimic Loops

**Crowley:** Distinguishes True Will (authentic direction) from ego delusion

**Codex parallel:** Clarified loops vs. mimic loops (degeneracy)

**Similarity:** Both recognize authentic vs. mechanical repetition.

## Tarot Correspondences

Crowley's Thoth Tarot has rich symbolic layers. Potential mappings:

| Codex Color | Possible Tarot Cards | Reasoning |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| ⚫ Black    | Death, The Tower    | Endings, dissolution |
| ⚪ White    | The High Priestess  | Mystery, structure |
| 🟡 Yellow   | The Magus           | Will, initiation |
| 🟤 Brown    | The Empress         | Earth, vessel, creation |
| 🔴 Red      | Strength, The Tower | Sacrifice, force |
| 🟢 Green    | Temperance, The Star| Symbiosis, balance |
| 🔵 Blue     | The Universe        | Completion, return |

**Caveat:** Tarot has 78 cards across multiple systems. Any mapping is reductive.

## Enochian System

Crowley worked extensively with Enochian magic (John Dee's angelic language).

**Potential parallels:**
- Enochian calls involve sequential operations (like color transitions)
- The Watchtowers have directional/elemental structure (like color operators)
- Enochian keys "open" different levels (like transitions between colors)

**See:** `enochian_analysis.md` for detailed comparison.

## Differences from Crowley's System

| Aspect | Crowley/Thelema | Seven Magicks Codex |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Structure** | Tree of Life (10 Sephirot) | 7-color cycle |
| **Directionality** | Vertical ascent/descent | Circular ±1 mod 7 |
| **Will emphasis** | Central (True Will) | One operator (Yellow) |
| **Enforcement** | Moral/spiritual guidance | Mathematical adjacency law |
| **Gray events** | Not formalized | Explicit error states |

## Open Questions

1. How do Crowley's planetary hours map to the 7-color cycle?
2. Is there a Codex equivalent to Crowley's HGA (Holy Guardian Angel)?
3. Can Thelemic rituals be encoded as color sequences?
4. What role does the 364/13 calendar play in relation to Crowley's calendar systems?
